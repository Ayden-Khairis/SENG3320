In order to run the junit tests, open intellij then open the project file you want to look at. For example Task 1 and 3 can just be opened to run the tests.
While Task 2 you have to open the folder and pick which tests you want to run. E.g CompareTo, ModInverse, and GCD junit tests. 

The only problem that could occur is if the sdk we used is not present on your computer. If this is the case just swap to the SDK that you have on your machine.
